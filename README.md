# Smashing Magazine Heatmap 🚧

> This project is a deconstruction of the website of popular internet magazine, Smashing Magazine. After recreating the structure of the original website, we coloured our version with greyscale according to the visual hierarchy of the original, in order to show where the website's design draws the eye using design principles like contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity.

The darkest shades represent the most eye-catching elements and the lightest colours represent the least eye-catching.
